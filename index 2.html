    <p> <b> Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19)</b> is a<h style="color:rgba(0, 15, 146, 0.966)" ;> contagious disease
        </h> caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
        coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) .The first known case was identified in<h style="color:rgb(35, 35, 129)";> Wuhan, China,</h> in December 2019.The disease
        has since spread worldwide,leading to an ongoing pandemic.</p>
    <h2 style="color: red; font-size: 20px;"><u><em> SYMPTOMS</em> </u> </h2>

    <p> <b>
            <h style="color:rgb(16, 16, 102)" ;>Symptoms of COVID-19 </h>
        </b> are variable, but often include fever, cough ,headache,fatigue, <h style="color:mediumblue" ;> breathing
            difficulties</h>, and
        <h style="color: mediumblue" ;>loss of smell</h> and<h style="color: mediumblue" ;> taste </h>.Symptoms may
        begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not
        develop noticeable symptoms.Of those people who develope symptoms noticeable
        enough to be classed as patients, most (80%) develop mild to moderate symptoms ( up to mild pneumonia),while 14%
        develop severe symptoms .
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: red; font-size: 20px;"> <u><em> DIAGNOSTIC METHOD </em></u></h3>
    <p> Several testing mathods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standardption polymerase chain reaction
        (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification(TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal
        amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab.Several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and distributed
        in varios countries ,which
        have initiated mass vaccination campaigns.Other prevemtive measures include physical or social distancing,
        quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces , covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed
        hands away from the face.</p>

    <h3 style="color: red;"><u><em> TREATMENT</em> </u> </h3>
    <p> There is no specific, effective treatment or cure for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by
        SARS-CoV-2 virus. One year into the pandemic, highly effective vaccines have noe been introduced and are
        begniing to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2; however, for those awaiting vaccination, as well as for the estimated
        millions of immunocompromised persons who are unlikely to respond robustly to vaccination,treatment remains
        important.</p>

    <p> Most cases of COVID-19 are mild. In these, supportive care includes medication such as paracetamol or NSAIDS to
        symptoms cough ,fever and nasal breathing.People with more severe cases may need treatment in Hospital. In those
        with low oxygen levels, use of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone is strongly recommended, as it can reduce the
        risk of death. Several experimental treatments are being actively studied in clinicaltrials. In Novemember 2021,
        the UK approved the use of Molnupiravir as a covid treatment for vulnerable patients recently diagnosed with the
        diseases.
